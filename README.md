# Kick Drop Miner

Kick Drop Miner automates watching Kick.com streams so you can keep drop timers moving without babysitting the site. The desktop app ships with a CustomTkinter UI, Selenium + undetected-chromedriver under the hood, persistent local storage, and smart handling for live/offline transitions.

## Highlights

- **Queue automation** - stack as many live URLs as you want, give each a minute target, and let the queue skip finished entries or re-queue offline ones automatically.
- **Drop campaign browser** - fetch the current Kick drop campaigns, preview the participating channels, and add any channel (or all of them) to your queue in one click.
- **Cookie workflow** - open a Chrome window to log in manually or import cookies directly from Chrome/Edge/Firefox via `browser_cookie3`; cookies are saved per domain under `./cookies/`.
- **Playback controls** - toggle mute, hide the `<video>` element, pop out the always-on-top mini player, or keep the normal Chrome window visible.
- **Profiles that persist** - `config.json` keeps your items, preferences, and paths, while `chrome_data/` stores a reusable Chrome profile and `cookies/` stores auth state.
- **Multi-language UI** - French, English, and Turkish translations are built in; the selected language and the light/dark theme are remembered.

## Requirements

- Windows 10/11, Linux (Ubuntu/Debian), or macOS
- Python 3.10+ (tested with 3.10, 3.12)
- Google Chrome installed
- Internet connection so `webdriver-manager` can download a matching ChromeDriver

### Optional extras

- `browser_cookie3` - enables the automatic cookie import flow
- `undetected-chromedriver` is already required; keep Chrome updated so the bundled driver version stays compatible
- A `.crx` extension or unpacked folder if you want to load a specific Chrome extension while mining

## Quick start

1. Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended)
   ```powershell
   py -3.10 -m venv .venv
   .\.venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
2. Install dependencies
   ```powershell
   pip install customtkinter pillow selenium webdriver-manager undetected-chromedriver
   pip install browser_cookie3  # optional but handy
   ```
3. Launch
   ```powershell
   python main.py
   ```
   On Windows you can also double-click `run.bat`.

## Signing in & cookies

- Click **Sign in (cookies)** to launch a Chrome window that points to the selected domain (for example `kick.com`). Log in, then press **OK** inside the app to persist the cookies to `cookies/<domain>.json`.
- If `browser_cookie3` is installed, the app can pull cookies straight from Chrome/Edge/Firefox without opening a window. This avoids extra 2FA prompts or 429 errors and is the fastest way to refresh auth.
- Cookies are stored per domain and are automatically applied before a worker navigates to a stream or before the drop campaign scraper hits `kick.com`.

## Adding streams

1. Press **Add link**, paste a Kick live URL (`https://kick.com/<channel>`), and enter the desired minutes (use `0` for infinite watch time).
2. The entry appears in the table with its target, current elapsed time, and state badge.
3. Use **Remove** to delete an entry. Removing an entry also stops its worker if it was running.
4. Finished entries are kept in `config.json`; you can reset them by removing the `finished` flag or by adding the URL again with a new target.

### Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)

1) Install system dependencies

   - Install Python 3 and tkinter (required for GUI):
     ```bash
     sudo apt update
     sudo apt install -y python3 python3-venv python3-tk
     ```

2) Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended)

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3) Install Python dependencies

   ```bash
   pip install --upgrade pip
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   
   Or install manually:
   ```bash
   pip install customtkinter pillow selenium webdriver-manager undetected-chromedriver setuptools
   ```

4) Run

   ```bash
   source venv/bin/activate
   python main.py
   ```

**Note:** On Linux, `tkinter` must be installed via the system package manager (`python3-tk`), as it cannot be installed via pip. The `setuptools` package is required for Python 3.12+ compatibility with `undetected-chromedriver`.

## Running the queue

- **Start queue** begins processing top-to-bottom. Offline channels are tagged `Retry` and revisited later to avoid wasting time.
- The timer only increments while the channel is truly live. If Kick reports the stream as offline mid-watch, the worker pauses and automatically resumes once it comes back online.
- Status tags show `LIVE`, `PAUSED`, `FINISHED`, or `STOP`. You can stop any selected entry with **Stop selected**.

## Drop campaign helper

- Click **Drops campaigns** to fetch active campaigns from `https://web.kick.com/api/v1/drops/campaigns`. The app spins up a tiny hidden Chrome session so it can pass Cloudflare and reuse your stored cookies.
- Browse each campaign, review the rewards, and view the participating channels (with avatars if Kick provides them).
- Use **Add this channel** to push a single entry into your queue or **Add all channels** to target every eligible channel of that campaign. The helper reuses the minutes selector so you can decide how long you want to farm.
- Because the fetch happens inside Chrome, the helper inherits any authenticated state you stored for `kick.com`, so you stay rate-limit friendly.

## Playback & visibility

- **Mute** enforces muted audio (re-applied periodically so Kick cannot unmute the tab).
- **Hide player** removes the `<video>` element while keeping playback going. With hide enabled, Chrome runs in a headless-like invisible window for the worker.
- **Mini player** spawns a small always-on-top overlay plus a reduced Chrome window. Hide player takes precedence over the mini player, so leave Hide off if you want the overlay.
- If you load an extension (`Chrome extension...` button), Chrome has to stay visible because Google disallows extensions in headless mode. The app detects this and adjusts visibility rules automatically.

## Data & persistence

- `config.json`
  - `items`: queue entries `{ url, minutes, finished, elapsed }`
  - `chromedriver_path`: optional manual override
  - `extension_path`: `.crx` file or unpacked extension directory
  - `mute`, `hide_player`, `mini_player`, `dark_mode`, `language`
- `cookies/`: JSON exports per domain (for example `cookies/kick.com.json`)
- `chrome_data/`: dedicated Chrome user data directory reused by Selenium
- `chromedriver-win64/`: downloaded drivers kept for offline reuse

## Troubleshooting

- **Chrome fails to launch** - make sure Chrome is installed and up to date. If you use a portable build or want a pinned driver, select it via **Chromedriver...**.
- **Timer does not move** - confirm that you are signed in and that the channel is really live. The timer intentionally pauses whenever Kick marks the channel offline.
- **429 / Too many requests** - favor the browser cookie import flow so you hit fewer login pages. If you must log in manually, wait 10-20 minutes between attempts and keep `chrome_data/` so Kick sees the same profile.
- **Mini player too small** - disable Mini player or Hide player to restore the normal Chrome window.
- **Need to re-watch a finished link** - edit `config.json` and remove the `finished` flag, or add the URL again.

## Tips & housekeeping

- Queue entries, preferences, and translations persist between launches, so you can close the app mid-run and resume later.
- The language selector and dark/light theme toggles are inside the UI footer; they sync to `config.json` instantly.
- Use the drops helper regularly to keep up with new campaigns and quickly repopulate your queue.
- When done, close the app and delete the folder to remove `config.json`, `cookies/`, and `chrome_data/`.
